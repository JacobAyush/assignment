    "Q1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "->. Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "->. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "->. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "->. The extensions for Python files is .py and .pyi\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "->. Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "->. The following are blocks: \n",
    "a. Module\n",
    "b. Function body\n",
    "c. Class definition. \n",
    "Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "->. We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character before any statement line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Mention function which can help us to find the version of Python that we are currently working out?\n",
    "->. To get the Version of the python Interpreter, they are listed as follows:\n",
    "    1. Using sys. version method.\n",
    "    2. Using python_version() function.\n",
    "    3. Using Python -V command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime,using a construct called?\n",
    "->. Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called \"lambda\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What does pip stand for Python?\n",
    "->.  pip stand for pip Install Packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Mention a few built-in function in Python?\n",
    "->.  A few of the frequently used built-in functions in Python programs are abs(x) for fetching the absolute value of x, bin() for getting the binary value, bool() for retrieving the boolean value of an object, list() for lists, len() to get the length of the value, open() to open the files, pow() for returning the power of a number, sum() for fetching the sum of the elements, reversed() for reversing the order, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifiers in Python?\n",
    "->.  An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "->.  Python programming is a general-purpose skill used in almost all fields, including: \n",
    "     Data science\n",
    "     Scientific and mathematical computing\n",
    "     Web development\n",
    "     Finance and trading\n",
    "     System automation and administration\n",
    "     Computer graphics\n",
    "     Basic game development\n",
    "     Security and penetration testing\n",
    "     General and application-specific scripting\n",
    "     Mapping and geography (GIS software)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "->.  Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "->.  to install we have to open a browser to the Python website and download the Windows installer. 2. Double click on the downloaded file and install Python for all users, and ensure that Python is added to your path. Click on Install now to begin.\n",
    "The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    "     1. Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "     2. Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "     3. Clicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.\n",
    "     4. In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "     5. Clicking on New and entering Python's install directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. Is indentation required in Python?\n",
    "->.  Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
